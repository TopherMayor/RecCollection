# Performance Optimization Plan

This document outlines the performance optimization strategy for the RecCollection application.

## Performance Metrics

We'll focus on the following key performance metrics:

1. **First Contentful Paint (FCP)**: Time until the first content is rendered
2. **Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)**: Time until the largest content element is rendered
3. **Time to Interactive (TTI)**: Time until the page becomes fully interactive
4. **Total Bundle Size**: Size of JavaScript, CSS, and other assets
5. **API Response Time**: Time taken for API requests to complete
6. **Memory Usage**: Amount of memory used by the application

## Optimization Areas

### 1. Code Splitting

Split the JavaScript bundle into smaller chunks to reduce initial load time:

- Route-based code splitting
- Component-based code splitting
- Vendor code splitting

### 2. Asset Optimization

Optimize assets to reduce load time:

- Image optimization (compression, responsive images)
- Font optimization (subset fonts, use system fonts)
- CSS optimization (minimize, purge unused styles)

### 3. Caching Strategy

Implement effective caching to reduce network requests:

- Browser caching
- Service worker caching
- API response caching

### 4. Lazy Loading

Defer loading of non-critical resources:

- Lazy load images
- Lazy load components
- Lazy load routes

### 5. API Optimization

Optimize API requests to reduce wait time:

- Request batching
- Response compression
- GraphQL for precise data fetching
- Pagination and infinite scrolling

### 6. React Optimization

Optimize React components for better performance:

- Memoization (React.memo, useMemo, useCallback)
- Virtual list for long lists
- Avoid unnecessary re-renders
- Use React.lazy and Suspense

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Measurement and Baseline

1. Set up performance monitoring tools
2. Establish performance baselines
3. Identify performance bottlenecks

### Phase 2: Quick Wins

1. Implement code splitting
2. Optimize images and assets
3. Implement lazy loading for images and components

### Phase 3: Advanced Optimizations

1. Implement caching strategy
2. Optimize API requests
3. Implement React performance optimizations

### Phase 4: Continuous Monitoring

1. Set up continuous performance monitoring
2. Establish performance budgets
3. Automate performance testing in CI/CD pipeline

## Performance Testing Tools

- Lighthouse: Overall performance auditing
- WebPageTest: Detailed performance analysis
- React Profiler: Component rendering performance
- Chrome DevTools: Network, performance, and memory profiling
- Cypress: End-to-end performance testing

## Performance Budgets

We'll establish the following performance budgets:

- First Contentful Paint: < 1.8s
- Largest Contentful Paint: < 2.5s
- Time to Interactive: < 3.5s
- Total Bundle Size: < 250KB (compressed)
- API Response Time: < 300ms (95th percentile)

## Monitoring and Reporting

We'll set up monitoring to track performance metrics over time:

- Lighthouse CI for automated performance testing
- Custom performance monitoring in the application
- Regular performance reviews and reports
