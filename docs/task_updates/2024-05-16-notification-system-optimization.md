```
### TASK-022: Notification System Optimization
- **State**: DONE
- **Priority**: HIGH
- **Description**: Optimize the notification system to reduce API calls and improve performance
- **Created**: May 16, 2024
- **Updated**: May 16, 2024
- **Dependencies**: TASK-009
- **Notes**: Implemented frontend polling optimization, backend caching, and rate limiting for notification endpoints
```

## Implementation Details

### Changes Made

1. **Frontend Optimization**:

   - Modified the `NotificationBell` component to accept an `isMobile` prop to distinguish between desktop and mobile instances
   - Added a global interval ID to ensure only one polling interval exists across multiple component instances
   - Added a flag to prevent concurrent API requests
   - Increased the polling interval from 30 seconds to 60 seconds
   - Made the mobile version only fetch once without setting up polling
   - Added logging to help debug API call frequency

2. **Backend Optimization**:

   - Implemented an in-memory cache for unread notification counts with a 30-second expiration
   - Added cache invalidation when notifications are marked as read or deleted
   - Added rate limiting middleware with different limits for read and write operations
   - Applied appropriate rate limits to all notification endpoints

3. **Additional Improvements**:
   - Added better error handling and logging
   - Added HTTP headers for rate limiting to help clients understand limits
   - Optimized the notification controller to use cached data when available

### Challenges

1. **Multiple Component Instances**: The `NotificationBell` component was being rendered twice in the Navbar (once for desktop and once for mobile), causing duplicate polling intervals and excessive API calls.

2. **Concurrent Requests**: Without proper request tracking, the component could make multiple concurrent requests to the same endpoint.

3. **Frequent Polling**: The original 30-second polling interval was too frequent for a notification system, causing unnecessary server load.

### Testing

The implementation was tested by:

1. Monitoring API calls in the browser console
2. Verifying that the unread count is correctly displayed
3. Testing notification interactions (marking as read, deleting)
4. Confirming that rate limiting works as expected

### Last Updated: May 16, 2024

#### Recently Completed Tasks

- Optimized notification system to reduce API calls and improve performance (TASK-022)
- Added backend caching for notification counts
- Implemented rate limiting for notification endpoints
- Added npm compatibility to the project (TASK-021)
- Updated all documentation to reflect npm/Bun compatibility
- Fixed backend server port configuration to consistently use port 3001

#### In Progress Tasks

- None currently in progress

#### Next Up Tasks

- Implement user notifications for social interactions
- Add recipe collections/folders feature
- Enhance mobile responsiveness

#### Known Issues

- Backend server has some compatibility issues when running with Node.js/npm - currently works best with Bun
```

## Next Steps

1. **Monitor Performance**: Continue monitoring the notification system's performance in production to ensure the optimizations are effective.

2. **Consider WebSockets**: For future improvements, consider implementing WebSockets for real-time notifications instead of polling.

## Branch Creation: api-docs-refactor

**2025-04-18 11:28:05** - Created new branch `api-docs-refactor` from `main` to:

- Restructure API documentation for better readability
- Add examples for all endpoints
- Include response schemas
- Document error codes

**Task Status**:

- [x] Branch created
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Review completed
- [ ] Merged to main

**Push Coordination**:

- Will push to remote after initial documentation updates are complete
- Requires review from @backend-team before merging
- Target merge date: 2025-04-20

3. **Distributed Caching**: If the application scales to multiple backend instances, consider implementing a distributed caching solution (like Redis) instead of in-memory caching.
