# RecCollection Deployment Strategy

## Overview
This document outlines the deployment strategy for the RecCollection application. It covers the environments, infrastructure, CI/CD pipeline, and monitoring approach to ensure reliable and efficient deployment of the application.

## Environments

### Development Environment
- **Purpose**: Local development and testing
- **Access**: Developers only
- **Data**: Mock data and development database
- **Configuration**: Development-specific settings
- **Deployment**: Manual, via local development server

### Staging Environment
- **Purpose**: Integration testing and QA
- **Access**: Internal team and testers
- **Data**: Anonymized production-like data
- **Configuration**: Production-like settings
- **Deployment**: Automated, triggered by merges to staging branch

### Production Environment
- **Purpose**: Live application for end users
- **Access**: Public
- **Data**: Production database with backups
- **Configuration**: Production settings with enhanced security
- **Deployment**: Automated, triggered by releases or merges to main branch

## Infrastructure

### Hosting Options

#### Option 1: Containerized Deployment (Recommended)
- **Container Orchestration**: Kubernetes or Docker Swarm
- **Cloud Provider**: AWS, GCP, or Azure
- **Benefits**: Scalability, isolation, consistent environments
- **Considerations**: Complexity, learning curve

#### Option 2: Platform as a Service (PaaS)
- **Provider**: Render, Railway, or Fly.io
- **Benefits**: Simplicity, managed infrastructure
- **Considerations**: Less flexibility, potential vendor lock-in

#### Option 3: Traditional VPS
- **Provider**: DigitalOcean, Linode, or AWS EC2
- **Benefits**: Full control, potentially lower cost
- **Considerations**: More maintenance, manual scaling

### Infrastructure Components

#### Backend
- **Runtime**: Bun in Docker container
- **API Server**: Hono application server
- **Load Balancer**: Nginx or cloud provider's load balancer
- **Scaling**: Horizontal scaling based on CPU/memory usage

#### Frontend
- **Hosting**: CDN with edge caching
- **Build**: Static assets built during CI process
- **Deployment**: Atomic deployments with instant rollback capability

#### Database
- **Primary**: PostgreSQL database
- **Backups**: Automated daily backups with point-in-time recovery
- **Scaling**: Vertical scaling for initial deployment, with option for read replicas

#### Storage
- **User Uploads**: Object storage (S3 or equivalent)
- **CDN**: For serving images and static assets

## CI/CD Pipeline

### Continuous Integration
- **Tool**: GitHub Actions
- **Trigger**: Pull requests and pushes to main branches
- **Steps**:
  1. Install dependencies
  2. Lint code
  3. Run unit tests
  4. Run integration tests
  5. Build application
  6. Generate test coverage report

### Continuous Deployment
- **Tool**: GitHub Actions or specialized deployment tool
- **Trigger**: Merges to environment-specific branches
- **Steps**:
  1. Build application
  2. Run end-to-end tests
  3. Create deployment artifact
  4. Deploy to target environment
  5. Run smoke tests
  6. Update monitoring

### Deployment Process
1. **Build Phase**:
   - Build frontend assets
   - Build backend application
   - Create Docker images

2. **Test Phase**:
   - Run automated tests against the built artifacts
   - Verify environment configuration

3. **Deploy Phase**:
   - Deploy database migrations
   - Deploy backend services
   - Deploy frontend assets
   - Update routing/load balancing

4. **Verification Phase**:
   - Run smoke tests
   - Verify application health
   - Monitor for errors

### Rollback Strategy
- **Automated Rollback**: Triggered by failed smoke tests or health checks
- **Manual Rollback**: Available through deployment dashboard
- **Database Rollbacks**: Revert migrations when possible
- **Versioned Artifacts**: Keep previous deployment artifacts for quick rollback

## Configuration Management

### Environment Variables
- Stored securely in environment-specific configuration
- No sensitive information in code repositories
- Loaded at runtime with appropriate defaults

### Secrets Management
- **Tool**: Cloud provider's secret management service or HashiCorp Vault
- **Access**: Restricted to authorized services and personnel
- **Rotation**: Regular rotation of sensitive credentials

### Feature Flags
- **Implementation**: Feature flag service or simple configuration
- **Purpose**: Control feature availability across environments
- **Gradual Rollout**: Enable percentage-based rollout for new features

## Database Management

### Migrations
- **Tool**: Drizzle migrations
- **Process**: Automated as part of deployment pipeline
- **Validation**: Tested in staging before production deployment

### Backup Strategy
- **Frequency**: Daily full backups
- **Retention**: 30 days of backups
- **Testing**: Regular backup restoration tests

### Scaling Strategy
- **Initial**: Single database instance with appropriate resources
- **Growth**: Read replicas for read-heavy operations
- **Long-term**: Consider sharding for very large datasets

## Monitoring and Observability

### Application Monitoring
- **Tool**: Datadog, New Relic, or open-source alternative
- **Metrics**: Response time, error rate, throughput
- **Dashboards**: Environment-specific dashboards for key metrics

### Log Management
- **Tool**: ELK Stack, Datadog, or cloud provider's logging service
- **Retention**: 30 days of logs
- **Searching**: Structured logging for efficient searching

### Error Tracking
- **Tool**: Sentry or equivalent
- **Alerts**: Immediate alerts for critical errors
- **Grouping**: Intelligent grouping of similar errors

### Performance Monitoring
- **Frontend**: Real User Monitoring (RUM)
- **Backend**: APM (Application Performance Monitoring)
- **Database**: Query performance monitoring

### Alerting
- **Channels**: Email, Slack, and SMS for critical alerts
- **On-call**: Rotation schedule for production issues
- **Escalation**: Clear escalation paths for different types of issues

## Security Considerations

### SSL/TLS
- HTTPS for all environments
- Automatic certificate renewal
- HTTP to HTTPS redirection

### Authentication
- Secure storage of authentication tokens
- Regular rotation of service account credentials
- Multi-factor authentication for admin access

### Network Security
- Firewall rules limiting access to necessary services
- Private networking for internal services
- DDoS protection

### Compliance
- Regular security scans
- Dependency vulnerability monitoring
- Compliance with relevant regulations (GDPR, etc.)

## Disaster Recovery

### Backup Strategy
- Database backups
- Configuration backups
- Infrastructure as Code for environment recreation

### Recovery Plan
- Documented recovery procedures
- Regular disaster recovery drills
- Estimated recovery time objectives (RTO)

### High Availability
- Multi-zone deployment where budget allows
- Redundant critical services
- Automated failover mechanisms

## Scaling Strategy

### Horizontal Scaling
- Auto-scaling based on load metrics
- Stateless application design
- Load balancing across instances

### Vertical Scaling
- Scheduled scaling for predictable load patterns
- Resource monitoring to identify bottlenecks
- Cost-efficient resource allocation

### Content Delivery
- CDN for static assets
- Edge caching for frequently accessed content
- Image optimization pipeline

## Cost Management

### Resource Optimization
- Right-sizing of infrastructure components
- Scheduled scaling down during low-traffic periods
- Reserved instances for predictable workloads

### Monitoring
- Cost alerts for unexpected increases
- Regular review of resource utilization
- Identification of optimization opportunities

### Budget Planning
- Monthly infrastructure budget
- Forecasting based on growth projections
- Clear allocation of costs to features
