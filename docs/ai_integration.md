# RecCollection AI Integration

## Overview
This document outlines the AI integration for the RecCollection application. The AI features will enhance the user experience by generating recipe names, descriptions, and providing other recipe-related suggestions based on ingredients and instructions.

## AI Features

### Recipe Name Generation
The system will generate creative and appropriate recipe names based on the ingredients and instructions provided by the user.

**Input:**
- List of ingredients
- Cooking instructions
- Optional cuisine type or category

**Output:**
- Generated recipe name

**Example:**
```
Input:
- Ingredients: chicken breast, garlic, lemon, olive oil, oregano, salt, pepper
- Instructions: Marinate chicken, grill until cooked
- Category: Mediterranean

Output:
"Mediterranean Lemon Garlic Grilled Chicken"
```

### Recipe Description Generation
The system will generate appealing and informative descriptions for recipes based on the ingredients, instructions, and recipe name.

**Input:**
- Recipe name
- List of ingredients
- Cooking instructions
- Optional cuisine type or category

**Output:**
- Generated recipe description

**Example:**
```
Input:
- Name: "Mediterranean Lemon Garlic Grilled Chicken"
- Ingredients: chicken breast, garlic, lemon, olive oil, oregano, salt, pepper
- Instructions: Marinate chicken, grill until cooked
- Category: Mediterranean

Output:
"This Mediterranean Lemon Garlic Grilled Chicken is a perfect summer dish that combines the bright flavors of lemon and garlic with aromatic oregano. Tender chicken breasts are marinated in a zesty mixture, then grilled to juicy perfection. Simple to prepare yet packed with flavor, this dish pairs wonderfully with a Greek salad and rice pilaf for a complete Mediterranean meal."
```

### Ingredient Substitution Suggestions
The system will suggest possible ingredient substitutions based on dietary restrictions, availability, or user preferences.

**Input:**
- Ingredient to substitute
- Reason for substitution (e.g., allergy, dietary restriction, unavailability)
- Recipe context (other ingredients, cooking method)

**Output:**
- List of potential substitutes with explanations

### Cooking Tips Generation
The system will generate helpful cooking tips related to the recipe being created.

**Input:**
- Recipe ingredients
- Cooking instructions
- Difficulty level

**Output:**
- List of cooking tips specific to the recipe

### Recipe Import Processing
The system will process imported content from social media platforms to extract recipe information.

**Input:**
- Text content from Instagram post or TikTok video
- Optional: Image or video content (via description)

**Output:**
- Structured recipe data (ingredients, instructions, etc.)

## Technical Implementation

### AI Service Selection
The application will use OpenAI's GPT models for text generation tasks. Specifically:
- GPT-4 for complex tasks like recipe import processing
- GPT-3.5 Turbo for simpler tasks like name generation

### API Integration
The backend will communicate with the OpenAI API through a dedicated AI service module.

```typescript
// AI Service Module Structure
class AIService {
  // Recipe name generation
  async generateRecipeName(ingredients: string[], instructions: string[], category?: string): Promise<string> {
    // Implementation
  }
  
  // Recipe description generation
  async generateRecipeDescription(name: string, ingredients: string[], instructions: string[], category?: string): Promise<string> {
    // Implementation
  }
  
  // Ingredient substitution
  async suggestIngredientSubstitutions(ingredient: string, reason: string, context: RecipeContext): Promise<Substitution[]> {
    // Implementation
  }
  
  // Cooking tips
  async generateCookingTips(recipe: Recipe): Promise<string[]> {
    // Implementation
  }
  
  // Recipe import processing
  async processImportedContent(content: string, source: 'instagram' | 'tiktok'): Promise<RecipeData> {
    // Implementation
  }
}
```

### Prompt Engineering
Carefully crafted prompts will be used to ensure high-quality AI-generated content.

**Example Prompt for Recipe Name Generation:**
```
Generate a creative and appealing recipe name based on the following ingredients and instructions. The name should be concise (3-7 words) and reflect the main ingredients, cooking method, or cuisine type.

Ingredients:
{ingredients_list}

Instructions:
{instructions_summary}

Category/Cuisine (if applicable):
{category}

Recipe Name:
```

### Caching Strategy
To optimize performance and reduce API costs, the application will implement caching for AI-generated content.

- Cache generated names and descriptions for common ingredient combinations
- Implement a TTL (time-to-live) strategy for cached content
- Use a distributed cache for scalability

### Error Handling
The application will implement robust error handling for AI service failures.

- Graceful degradation when AI services are unavailable
- Fallback options for critical features
- User-friendly error messages
- Retry mechanisms with exponential backoff

## User Experience

### AI Feature Integration Points
The AI features will be integrated into the user interface at the following points:

1. **Recipe Creation Form:**
   - "Generate Name" button after entering ingredients and instructions
   - "Generate Description" button after entering recipe details
   - Ingredient substitution suggestions as inline helpers

2. **Recipe Import:**
   - Automatic processing of imported content
   - User review and editing of AI-extracted information

3. **Recipe Viewing:**
   - Cooking tips displayed alongside recipe instructions

### User Controls
Users will have control over AI-generated content:

- Accept/reject generated content
- Edit generated content before saving
- Disable AI features in user settings

## Ethical Considerations

### Data Privacy
- No user recipe data will be stored by the AI service provider
- Anonymized prompts will be used when communicating with external AI services
- Clear privacy policy regarding AI feature usage

### Content Moderation
- AI-generated content will be filtered for inappropriate language
- User review required before publishing AI-generated content
- Reporting mechanism for problematic AI-generated content
