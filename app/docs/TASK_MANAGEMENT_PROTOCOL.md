# RecCollection Task Management Protocol

This document serves as the central reference for all AI agents working on the RecCollection project. It provides a standardized approach to task management, ensuring continuity and efficient handoffs between different agents.

## Task Tracking System

All tasks for the RecCollection project are tracked in this document. Each task has:

- **ID**: A unique identifier (e.g., TASK-001)
- **Title**: A concise description
- **Description**: Detailed explanation of requirements
- **State**: Current status (see [Task States](#task-states))
- **Priority**: Importance level (see [Task Prioritization](#task-prioritization))
- **Dependencies**: Other tasks that must be completed first
- **Assignee**: Who is working on it (typically "AI Agent")
- **Created**: When the task was created
- **Updated**: When the task was last updated
- **Notes**: Additional information, progress updates, or implementation details

## Task States

Tasks move through the following states:

1. **BACKLOG**: Identified but not yet scheduled
2. **TODO**: Scheduled for implementation
3. **IN_PROGRESS**: Currently being worked on
4. **REVIEW**: Implementation complete, awaiting review
5. **DONE**: Completed and approved
6. **BLOCKED**: Cannot proceed due to dependencies or issues

## Task Prioritization

Tasks are prioritized using the following levels:

1. **CRITICAL**: Must be addressed immediately (blocking issues, security vulnerabilities)
2. **HIGH**: Important for the next release
3. **MEDIUM**: Should be addressed soon but not urgent
4. **LOW**: Nice to have, can be deferred

## Implementation Guidelines

When implementing tasks, follow these guidelines:

1. **Consistency**: Follow established patterns in the codebase
2. **Modularity**: Create reusable components and services
3. **Testing**: Add appropriate tests for new functionality
4. **Documentation**: Update relevant documentation
5. **Performance**: Consider performance implications
6. **Security**: Follow security best practices
7. **Accessibility**: Ensure features are accessible

## Handoff Protocol

When handing off work between AI agents:

1. Update the task status in this document
2. Document the current state of implementation
3. Note any challenges or considerations
4. List the next steps for the task
5. Update the [Current Task Status](#current-task-status) section

## Documentation Standards

All code should be documented according to these standards:

1. **Components**: Document props, state, and key functionality
2. **Functions**: Document parameters, return values, and side effects
3. **APIs**: Document endpoints, request/response formats
4. **Database**: Document schema changes and migrations

## Current Task Status

This section provides a snapshot of the current state of development. It should be updated with each session.
